EC2 :

Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable, secure virtual machines (called instances) in the AWS Cloud.
You can think of EC2 as a computer in the cloud that you can use to host websites, run apps, store data, or run
scripts — without buying physical hardware.

⚙️ How EC2 Works:

    You launch an EC2 instance (a virtual machine).

    You choose the OS, size (CPU, RAM), and storage.

    You connect to it using SSH (for Linux) or RDP (for Windows).

    You install software, host applications, or store files.

    You stop, start, scale, or delete the instance anytime.
