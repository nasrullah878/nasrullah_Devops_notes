🧠 What is NAT (Network Address Translation)?

NAT is a function your router uses to let many devices (private IPs) share one public IP (given by your ISP) to access the internet.
✅ Simple Example:
🏠 In your home:
Device	Private IP
Laptop	192.168.1.2
Phone	192.168.1.3
Smart TV	192.168.1.4
Router	192.168.1.1 (Gateway)
Router Public IP	102.23.45.67 (from ISP)
🌍 You open your phone and go to www.google.com

Here’s what happens step by step:
1. 📱 Your phone wants to talk to Google

    It uses its private IP: 192.168.1.3

    But Google can’t see private IPs — they are not routable on the internet.

2. 🔄 Your router steps in (NAT)

    The router changes the sender IP from 192.168.1.3 to 102.23.45.67 (its public IP)

    It keeps a record in a table like:

Source Private IP	Port	Translated to Public IP:Port
192.168.1.3	55001	102.23.45.67:60001
3. 🌐 The request goes to Google

    Google sees it coming from 102.23.45.67

    Google replies back to your router at 102.23.45.67

4. 📬 Router gets the reply

    Router checks the port in its NAT table.

    It sees: “Oh, this was originally from 192.168.1.3 (your phone).”

    Router sends the reply back to your phone at 192.168.1.3

🎯 In short:

    Devices inside your home use private IPs like 192.168.x.x

    They can’t directly access the internet

    Your router replaces the private IP with its public IP

    It tracks who made the request

    When replies come back, it sends them to the correct device

🔐 Bonus: Why is NAT useful?

    Saves public IPs (only one needed)

    Adds basic security (outside world doesn’t see your device IPs)

    Lets many devices use internet at once
